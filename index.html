        <h2>Brief History of the City</h2>
        <p>
          Before the arrival of the Spanish, this territory was known by the
          Mayans as T’ho, which means "Five hills", and long ago it received the
          name Ichcaanzihó, which means "face of infinity." On the vestiges of
          said Mayan settlement, the city was founded on January 6, 1542 by Don
          Francisco de Montejo "El Mozo", who named it Mérida because the old
          pre-Hispanic buildings reminded him of the Roman ruins that are
          preserved in the homonymous city. from Extremadura, Spain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The center of the city was reserved for the Plaza Mayor and the sacred
          stones of the indigenous temples were used to build the houses and
          public buildings for the conquerors, such as the Royal Houses and the
          Cabildo, as well as the temples of the new Christian faith. , among
          which the Cathedral of San Ildefonso stands out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mérida is characterized by its colonial architecture, in a sober
          style, where there are buildings with high ceilings and large windows
          (predominantly in the current Historic Center); But above all, it is
          recognized for the color of the quarry, a material typical of the
          region with which many of its buildings were built, which makes the
          sunlight stand out even more, an aspect that has earned it the
          nickname of Ciudad Blanca in our days. , a fact also supported by the
          tradition of its inhabitants, maintained for many years, of using
          bright colors to paint their properties.
